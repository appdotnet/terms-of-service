Last Revised: December 30, 2013

App.net respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same.

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), the text of which may be found on the U.S. Copyright Office website at [http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf](http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf), and other applicable laws, App.net has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at App.net's sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. App.net may also, at its sole discretion, limit access to App.netâ€™s website and services (collectively, "Service") and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement. App.net will respond to claims of copyright infringement committed on the App.net website that are reported to App.net's Designated Copyright Agent, identified in the sample notice below.

If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.

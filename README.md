# App.net Terms of Service

The App.net terms of service documents live here. To facilitate transparent discussion, we encourage users to create issues and/or
submit pull requests with your feedback. Our general process is to incorporate user feedback on a roughly quarterly basis based on
review with our legal team, but in the early stages this may occur significantly more often.

## Document locations

The canonical locations for the effective versions of these documents at any given time are:

* Terms of Service: [https://alpha.app.net/legal/terms/](https://alpha.app.net/legal/terms/)
* Privacy Policy: [https://alpha.app.net/legal/privacy/](https://alpha.app.net/legal/privacy/)
* Copyright Policy: [https://alpha.app.net/legal/copyright/](https://alpha.app.net/legal/copyright/)
* Subscription Terms: [https://alpha.app.net/legal/subscription-terms/](https://alpha.app.net/legal/subscription-terms/)

* Incentive Program Terms: [https://alpha.app.net/legal/incentive-terms/](https://alpha.app.net/legal/incentive-terms/)

While we will make reasonable attempts to maintain a "effective-versions" branch here in GitHub, as well as tags to show which specific version(s) have been made effective, in all cases the only effective documents will be located at the above URLs, not in git.

# App.net - Subscription Terms

Last Updated: February 7, 2013

By purchasing a subscription you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the Subscription Terms in effect at the time of your purchase. Your purchases through App.net's website and your use of App.net's service are also governed by App.net's terms of service (which are incorporated by reference in these subscription terms).

Except as otherwise stated, these Subscription Terms are subject to change at any time and in App.net's sole discretion. Any changes are effective six (6) weeks after we post such revised Subscription Terms to our website (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Subscription Terms), or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Subscription Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the website regularly for changes to these Subscription Terms. If you do not agree to these Subscription Terms, please do not purchase a subscription.

If you have any questions regarding these Subscription Terms, please contact App.net by emailing [support@app.net](mailto:support@app.net).

## Purchase & Account Security

In order to purchase a subscription, you must set up a registered account with App.net. You will provide accurate and complete information in your App.net user account at all times, including, but not limited to, your billing address, email address, telephone number, a valid credit card number or other account number, and the credit card expiration date. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of, and restricting access to, your account, username and password.

## Prices & Availability

All prices are shown in U.S. dollars. While we have the right to change the prices at any time, the prices associated with your subscription will become effective subject to the renewal provisions below.

## Payment Options

App.net accepts payments by VISA, MasterCard, Discover and American Express credit cards. By submitting your order, you acknowledge that you are authorized to use the designated credit card and you authorize App.net to charge your order (including taxes and any other amounts described on App.net's website) to that credit card. If the card cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your order may be suspended or cancelled automatically. Card processing fees may apply even if the card has expired or changed by the time App.net submits the charges.

## Cancellations and Refunds

You may terminate or suspend your account by e-mailing [support@app.net](mailto:support@app.net).  However, there are no refunds, except as provided in these Subscription Terms or as required by law. You understand that charges for the Service must be paid in advance.

## Renewals

At the expiration of your subscription, App.net will automatically bill your credit card for an additional service term equal to the length of time of your original subscription.  In the case of an annual membership, App.net will notify you by e-mail no later than 30 days prior to expiration of your subscription and provide instructions for cancelling service if you do not wish to renew it. Unless you notify App.net that you wish to cancel your services prior to the cancellation of your subscription, your subscription will automatically renew. For all membership tiers, the renewal fees will be equal to the lowest published Service fees for your member tier as published by App.net at the renewal date.

## Taxes

You are responsible for any taxes that you are obligated to pay or that App.net may collect from you in connection with your purchase. If you do not pay the sales or other taxes or fees on a transaction, you will be responsible for the taxes or fees in the event they are later determined to be payable on the sale, and App.net reserves the right to collect the taxes or other fees from you at any time.

# App.net â€“ Developer Terms of Service and License Agreement

Last Updated: September 26, 2012

We strongly believe that third-party development increases the value and attractiveness of the App.net service to our members, and thus, that our interests are fundamentally aligned with yours. Through transparent policies and a flexible API, our goal is to empower developers to create a wide variety of interesting, innovative applications for App.net users.

These terms and conditions ("Developer Terms") apply to the use by any developer of the App.net application programming interface and other related materials provided by App.net (collectively, the "API"). Please read them carefully.

## Accepting these Developer Terms

By signing up for a developer account and accessing the App.net API, you agree to be bound by all of the terms below. If you are agreeing to these Developer Terms on behalf of a company or legal entity, you represent that you are authorized and legally able to bind such company or legal entity to these Developer Terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the API. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing [support@app.net](mailto:support@app.net).

## Changes to these Developer Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Developer Terms at any time.

Whenever we make changes to these Developer Terms, the changes are effective six (6) weeks after we post such revised Developer Terms to our website (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Developer Terms), or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Developer Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the website regularly for changes to these Developer Terms.

If you continue to use the API after the revised Developer Terms are in effect, then you have accepted the revised Developer Terms.

## Grant of API License

Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Developer Terms, App.net grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the API solely for the purpose of developing and implementing applications that interoperate or interface directly with the App.net service (the "Applications").

## Application Requirements

All Applications created using the API must include a conspicuous link to a terms of service agreement applicable to the end user's use of such Application and to a privacy policy that details how you collect, use, store, and disclose data collected from end users. Your terms of service and privacy policy must respect the rights of App.net end users in a manner generally consistent with the App.net Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

All Applications must comply with any applicable requirements or use restrictions associated with the end user's content as specified by the applicable end user. Further, if you send any direct communication to individual end users outside of channels provided by the API (e.g., an e-mail), you must include a mechanism enabling end users to stop receiving such communications.

You may use the API to create Applications that include advertising or marketing materials or that are designed for a commercial or business purpose. You acknowledge that is in the sole discretion of App.net end users whether to follow or use any Application that you create.

## License Restrictions

You are not permitted to install or use the API for any other purpose other than those contemplated in these Developer Terms without App.net's prior written consent. You will not use the API to infringe upon, violate, dilute or misappropriate the patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy, right of publicity or other intellectual or other right of any party.

Further, you will not use the API:

* to violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation;
* to create Applications which are defamatory, libelous, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, obscene, pornographic or indecent;
* to "spam" or harass App.net users by sending unsolicited messages, notifications, comments or other unwelcome content;
* to create an Application that introduces or propagates unauthorized data, malware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, worms, other malicious or harmful code;
* to create an Application that posts or deletes content on behalf of an App.net user without their authorization or initiation of such actions; or
* in a manner that adversely impacts the stability of App.net's servers, or otherwise adversely impacts the functionality or use of the App.net website or other applications using the API.

## Proprietary Rights

As between you and App.net, all right, title and interest in and to the API (including all intellectual property rights therein) are and will at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of App.net. These Developer Terms do not include the right for you to use any trademark, service mark, trade name or any other mark of App.net or any other party, with the exception of any assets provided and licensed to you on [our developer assets page](/legal/assets/). No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly and unambiguously set forth herein.

Except as expressly permitted in these Developer Terms, you will not:

* distribute the API to any third party;
* sell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise commercially exploit the API;
* improve, prepare derivative works of or otherwise modify the API;
* reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code from the API; or
* remove, obscure, or alter any intellectual property right or confidentiality notices or legends appearing in or on any aspect of the API or the App.net website.

When you provide us with any feedback, comments or suggestions about the API, these Developer Terms and, in general, App.net, you irrevocably assign to us all of your right, title and interest in and to your feedback, comments and suggestions.

## Developer Incentive Program

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT WILL APP.NET BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE API OR ANY APPLICATION AND/OR CONTENT INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE API OR ANY APPLICATION, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR ARE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
